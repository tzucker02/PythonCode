# PythonCode
After some rather intensive courses, one of which was all about coding in Python - using Jupyter notebooks, I kind of got hooked.  I continued doing some Python coding because it was, well. fun! If that makes me a geek, so be it.  In the end, I wrote several little Python functions that did a lot of what my professor had been asking us to do during the semester, but did it in a much easier way (at least for anyone else who is using the functions). I have uploaded a couple of them here. If you find them at all useful, feel free to credit me. On the other hand, if you find they need reworking, I am also happy to hear about it. Whether you have suggestions, problems, or just want to talk about Pythonic issues, contact me!

Now for the code ...

- [Model and evaluate different models](https://github.com/tzucker02/PythonCode/blob/main/model_eval.ipynb)
- [Run other NB and put resultant timings in python dictionary](https://github.com/tzucker02/PythonCode/blob/main/run_other_nb_with_timings.ipynb)
